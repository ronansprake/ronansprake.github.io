If you're looking for a board gaming group local to Hethersett, please [message me](https://ronansprake.co.uk/hethersett-board-game-group#contact) and let's try to set one up!

I've got a modest collection (mostly light/medium weight) and I know a few people who could bring games, but I've never taken the step to finding a venue and organising a group.

Alternatively, I recommend the Mulbarton group, they meet every other Sunday evening at their social club (search for them on Facebook).
