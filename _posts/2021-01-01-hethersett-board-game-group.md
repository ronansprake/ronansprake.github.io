Looking for a board gaming group near Hethersett? [Say hi](https://ronansprake.co.uk/hethersett-board-game-group#contact) and let's make it happen!

I've not taken the step to finding a venue and organising a group - it's always easier when it's not just me - but I've got games (mostly light/medium weight) and I know a few people who might come along.

I started a film club a few years ago by posting a similar thing, so it might seem odd thing to do, but it worked for me last time!
