Too many board games, no patience for scoring. So, I built a few calculators&hellip;

- [7 Wonders Duel score calculator (includes Pantheon expansion)](//ronansprake.co.uk/7-wonders-duel-score-calculator)
- [30 Rails score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/30-rails-score-calculator)
- [A Feast for Odin score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/feast-for-odin-score-calculator)
- [Cascadia score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/cascadia-score-calculator)
- [Kingdomino score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/kingdomino-score-calculator)
- [Lost Cities card game score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/lost-cities-score-calculator)
- [Wingspan score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/wingspan-score-calculator)

Here's my Targi solo automa / bot, it uses the official solo rules (with some optional house rules):

Here's a simple 2 player Onitama assistant - you'll need a physical 5x5 grid and pieces to play (e.g. a chess board). Includes expansion and promo cards!
