I love board games, but have little patience for scoring. Plus, it's easy to make mistakes, so I've built a few calculators for some recent favourites.

- [7 Wonders Duel score calculator (includes Pantheon expansion)](//ronansprake.co.uk/7-wonders-duel-score-calculator)
- [30 Rails score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/30-rails-score-calculator)
- [A Feast for Odin score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/feast-for-odin-score-calculator)
- [Cascadia score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/cascadia-score-calculator)
- [Kingdomino score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/kingdomino-score-calculator)
- [Wingspan score calculator](//ronansprake.co.uk/wingspan-score-calculator)

Here's my Targi solo automa, since I couldn't find one online. It uses the official solo rules, with some optional house rules:
